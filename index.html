            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>A Mission statement is one of the most powerful tools you have for leading your business or
                organization
                to success. A mission statement takes the 'why' of what you do and consolidates it into about one to
                two
                sentences. A strong mission statement will contain four key elements: value, inspiration,
                plausibility,
                specificity.</p>

            <h3>Vission</h3>
            <p>A Vission statement describes what a company desires to achieve in the long-run, generally in a time
                frame of five to ten years, or sometimes even longer. The main elements of an effective vision
                statement
                are forward looking, motivating and inspirational, reflective of a company's culture and core values
                etc.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>A Goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envision, plan
                and
                commit to achieve. people endeavour to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines. A Goal
                is
                roughly similar to a purpose or aimn the anticipated result which guides reaction, or an end, which
                is
                an object, either a physical object or an abstract object, that has intrinsic value.</p>

            <h3>Without Limits</h3>
            <p>Without limit means with no restriction. I mean the potential energy does not increase without limit.
                Develop means grow or cause to grow and become more mature, advanced, or eleborate. So develop without
                limits means to grow or change into a more advanced, larger or stronger form or to make something do
                this with no restriction.</p><br>

            <p>My name is Md. Saiyadul Amin Akhand. Nick name Sayed. I'm from Cumilla and currently live in Boardbazar,
                Gazipur. There are nine members in my family including me. I have completed my Bsc in CSE and MBA(HRM)
                in 2014
                and 2019 respectively. My strength is hard work, never giving up being flexible to learn new things. My
                weakness is that I easily trust anyone. I like to spend my free time reading books, learning something
                new and innovative that enhance my knowledge and skill. My short-term goal is to get a job in a well
                reputed company like yours and my long-term goal is to gain work experience and knowledge to contribute
                to the growth of the company. </p>
            <p>That's all about me.</p>
