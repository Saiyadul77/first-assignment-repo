            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>A Mission statement is one of the most powerful tools you have for leading your business or
                organization
                to success. A mission statement takes the 'why' of what you do and consolidates it into about one to
                two
                sentences. A strong mission statement will contain four key elements: value, inspiration,
                plausibility,
                specificity.</p>

                frame of five to ten years, or sometimes even longer. The main elements of an effective vision
                statement
                are forward looking, motivating and inspirational, reflective of a company's culture and core values
                etc.</p>
